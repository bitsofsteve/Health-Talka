## How to use this example?

You can test the example using the following
steps:

1. Install Rasa by running (Skip if you have rasa installed already):

    Visit [Rasa Guide For Installation](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/)
    

1. Train a Rasa model containing the Rasa NLU and Rasa Core models by running:
    ```
    rasa train
    ```
    The model will be stored in the `/models` directory as a zipped file.

  

3. Test the assistant by running:
    ```
    rasa run actions
    ```
    This will run the actions in an ednpoint.

4. Then to use Rasa x to test (rasa x can allow to test the button feel of delivering Payloads)

   ```
   rasa x
   ```
   This will start up Rasa x, then you can talk to the bot

   Note: for some reasons ``` run actions``` and ```rasa shell``` have port conflicts
